Dismissing any talk of payment, Edison said he would supply the ideas and illustrations, leaving the professional to do the actual writing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lathrop promptly secured serial-publication rights with McClure Newspaper Syndicate and set up camp near Edison's lab in West Orange, New Jersey, in September 1890, eager for the chance to dive into work.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">The inventor refused to elaborate on his futuristic concepts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Things got off to a promising start when Edison sent him 33 pages of notes the following month. Lathrop went through the scribbled descriptions of "screwless steamships," "hypnotizing machines" and other oddities and returned the pages, asking for further explanation of the terminology.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Edison had bigger fish to fry, as he was hard at work on a groundbreaking motion picture camera called the Kinetograph. He sent Lathrop another set of hastily scrawled notes, along with drawings of an "air-ship," but offered little clarification on his fanciful musings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His advance money drying up, Lathrop appealed to McClure for an extension and attempted to get the story moving with the available information. He banged out a few chapters and relayed them to Edison for approval, waiting for the feedback that never arrived.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He did hear from his elusive colleague in early January 1891, after the New York newspaper the Sun wrote of an exciting new work of fiction to come from the famed inventor and co-writers Robert Louis Stevenson and Rudyard Kipling. Edison blasted Lathrop for his "act of bad faith" and threatened to end their partnership. Lathrop pleaded innocence, pointing out that he wasn't even named in the story.</p><img alt="thomas edison seated at his desk writing in 1905" title="Thomas Edison seated at his desk writing in 1905" width=4296 height=3450 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-653395394.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Thomas Edison writing at his desk in 1905</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Edison was focused on his motion picture camera and mining complex</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That spring, as he sought to get out in front of the race to develop motion picture technology, Edison asked Lathrop to write a piece on his still-secret Kinetograph. He then leaked the story to the Sun, as he had accused Lathrop of doing months earlier, robbing his collaborator of the scoop when his article appeared in Harper's shortly afterward.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By summer, the ever-busy inventor had turned his focus to building an electromagnetic mining complex in western New Jersey. Upon learning that Edison was living there, Lathrop poured his pent-up frustration into a letter that August, writing, "I will ask you to try to realize what it is to me to be forced to hang around like a dog waiting for a bone — & not even getting the bone."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His subsequent pleas to return to Progress were tamer, but the "Wizard of Menlo Park" was ready to move on. Turning down Edison's offer to compensate him for the wasted time, Lathrop spent the next few years trying to pull a coherent story out of the rambling notes and muddled memories.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">The story appeared in newspapers as 'In the Deep of Time'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fruits of their stilted collaboration finally saw the light of day when the now renamed In the Deep of Time surfaced in newspapers in 1896, with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015056059861&view=1up&seq=695" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lathrop's foreword" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Lathrop's foreword</a> explaining how the story grew from "conversations" with the great inventor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the Deep of Time tells the tale of a heartsick Gerald Bemis, who undergoes "vivification" to enter a state of suspended animation and awakens to the wonders of the 22nd century. But beyond its depictions of antigravity ships, communications with intellectually superior Martians and factories that take up entire cities, the story wasn't strong enough to stand out in an era of robust science fiction readership and In the Deep of Time vanished from the public realm after its syndicated run.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lathrop also faded into obscurity following his death from alcoholism in 1898, at age 46. And Edison continued plugging on with his Kinetograph, his electromagnetic mine, his alkaline battery and so much more, his detour into science fiction a minor chapter in an overflowing life story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGigp66Vo8GwvtJoq6GnnZbAbrHDoqqopl2osKp5xaJkp6emmrk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The family of real estate tycoon Todd Chrisley starred in nine seasons of the popular USA Network series, before <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their legal troubles</a> caught up to them. The show was even popular enough to spawn a spin-off, titled Growing Up Chrisley, but the future of both shows has been cut short in the wake of the Chrisleys’ sentencing.</p><p data-characters=596 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>Todd and Julie Chrisley are officially in the hands of federal officials, following a trial that found them guilty of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fraud and tax crimes</a>. They face a collective 19 years in prison for their crimes, and both of the shows they are associated with have already been canceled. Fans of Chrisly Knows Best are shaken by the news, after following the family for nearly a decade via their reality shows, and they’re looking for comfort — and maybe hints toward the Chrisleys’ eventual downfall — in old episodes. Here’s where you can watch the Chrisley family series for yourself.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-chrisley-knows-best-about data-injectable=false>What is Chrisley Knows Best about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=903 data-injectable=true>Chrisley Knows Best hits all the notes of your classic family reality show, following the lives of the affluent Chrisley family. Each member of the family has their own quirky personality traits and habits, and their dynamic — as well as the lens into high-income America — fascinated viewers for nearly a decade. Their over-the-top lifestyle and various rich people problems, paired with the family patriarch’s tendency to micromanage, helped the show keep its head above water for a full nine seasons, but — with Todd and Julie headed to prison — it won’t be returning for a tenth.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where to watch Chrisley Knows Best</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chrisley.jpg><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=788 data-injectable=true>Chrisley Knows Best can be viewed via several streaming options — in some areas of the world, at least.

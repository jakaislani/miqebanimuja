Her father, Ernie Lively, was an actor, and her mother, Elaine, worked as a talent scout. Her grandmother’s brother inspired the name “Lively” for her. She has three half-siblings from her mother’s previous marriage: Lori, Robyn, and Jason, and an elder brother named Eric. Her siblings and dad have all held jobs in the entertainment business.</p><p>Because her parents did not want to leave her with a babysitter, Lively attended acting school with them as a child. She claimed that learning the “drills” and gaining confidence as she grew older and started working in the profession came from watching her parents teach. When she was 10 years old, Lively made her acting debut in the father-directed movie Sandman in 1998. She calls her portion a “bit part,” as she puts it. She planned to enroll at Stanford University and initially had little interest in acting.</p><p>She was a cheerleader, a part of the winning chorus, and the class president at Burbank High School. In the summer, her older brother requested that his talent agent send her to many auditions. In The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005), she was subsequently cast as Bridget, and between her junior and senior years of high school, she recorded her sequences.</p><p>In 2005, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was published. Lively was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for “Choice Movie Breakout – Female” because of her performance. Lively and Justin Long co-starred in the horror movie Accepted in 2006, and Lively also played supporting roles in Simon Says. Although Accepted did not garner favorable reviews from reviewers, Lively’s performance did, and Hollywood Life gave her a “Breakthrough Award.” Lively played Anabelle, a bulimic girl who aspired to win a beauty pageant, in the 2007 film Elvis and Anabelle. Lively remarked that she had “shed substantial weight” for her height in order to get into character for the part. She claimed that because eating is “my No. 1 love in life,” the procedure was challenging for her. Her portrayal in the movie was acclaimed by MovieLine.com, which called it her “breakthrough role.”</p><p>The CW’s Gossip Girl, which debuted in September 2007 and was based on the Cecily von Ziegesar novel series of the same name, cast Lively in the lead role. Lively already planned to decline the job and enroll in college, but she was informed she could do so while filming the show (she subsequently commented, “This is advised to anyone: when they say, “We promise, but we can’t put it in writing,’ there’s a reason they can’t put it in writing”). Up until the show’s cancellation in 2012, she portrayed Serena van der Woodsen in the teen drama. In the November 2007 issue of CosmoGirl, she appeared on the cover and talked about her high school years and career before Gossip Girl.</p><p>The 2016 psychological thriller All I See is You, starring Lively and Jason Clarke, received mixed reviews upon its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Lively appeared in the 2018 mystery thriller A Simple Favor alongside Henry Golding and Anna Kendrick. The film was directed by Paul Feig. Lively’s performance in the movie, which debuted on September 14, received positive reviews.</p><p>She has her moments, many of them physically violent, and Lively’s Emily is both repulsive and alluring, according to Variety. The Rhythm Section, the film version of the same-named Mark Burnell novel produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and directed by Reed Morano, featured Lively as the lead, a drug-addicted prostitute turned assassin. On January 31, 2020, Paramount Pictures released the movie. According to Variety, Lively’s portrayal of a dangerous situational near-incapability “makes her empathetic in ways few cinematic assassins have ever been,”</p><p>It was revealed in May 2021 that Lively would play the title role of Josie Schuller in Lady Killer. The music video for Taylor Swift’s song “I Bet You Think About Me,” which features American singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton and was released on November 15, 2021, from Swift’s re-recorded album Red (Taylor’s Version), marked Lively’s debut in the director’s chair (2021). It was revealed in April 2022 that Lively will make her feature film debut directing an adaptation of Bryan Lee O’Malley’s comic novel Seconds, with Edgar Wright penning the screenplay and serving as producer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Lively Husband and Kids</h2><p>Lively dated Penn Badgley, a co-star on the hit series Gossip Girl, from 2007 to 2010.

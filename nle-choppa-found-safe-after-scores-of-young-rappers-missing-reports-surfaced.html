The concerns arose when his mother, Angela Potts, also his manager, took to social media on Friday afternoon to express her worry about not having heard from him for hours.</p><p>In a heartfelt plea on Instagram, Potts asked for prayers and information regarding her son’s whereabouts. She shared, “Y’all, help me pray over my child. He plans on moving back to Cottonwood, where we worked hard to get out of, just for a mixtape. SMH! I ain’t talked to this boy in hours, and he usually doesn’t do this. One thing I know about my son is that he doesn’t go ghost for any reason. Whatever you’re working on, I pray God is guiding you. If y’all hear from him, please contact me ASAP. To the fans he wants to please, thanks a lot.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Momma Choppa.

She thanked his supporters and explained that he had taken some time to himself, saying, “He just needed a minute but didn’t communicate it to his loved ones. I never intended to scare anyone with my post, nor did I expect for people to think he is missing, but the frustrations of being the mother of a celebrity can be a bit much and overwhelming at times.”</p><p>NLE Choppa himself took to social media to clarify the situation, expressing gratitude for the concern while emphasizing that he was never missing. He wrote, “I appreciate ya’ll showing concern but the missing narrative isn’t cool, especially knowing that people really do go missing every day. I took a little time to myself to get back to my roots, but trust I’m all good. Apologies to anyone that was worried. We don’t run from battles; we take ’em up chin up. IM BACK.”</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/l2ZDYuJ8JI</a></p><p>— NLE Choppa (@Nlechoppa1) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 21, 2023</a></p><p>NLE Choppa’s fans can now rest assured that the artist is in good health and pursuing his musical endeavors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ku62xjJyfqKiglnqnu9Snm2arkZuybq3FrZyrZaOYvLOx0mamn2WppMKvs4yrmKmolafAbrnIrKqippdiv6a8zqurrGWjqr%2BnrcKem2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

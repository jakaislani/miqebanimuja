その内容とは、人気漫画「ワンピース」のキャラクターにガチで恋する「夢女子」と呼ばれる女性たちの独自文化の中で起きたすれ違いです。
コレコレさんにネタを提供した夢女子と、悪く言われた夢女子のバトルでありました。
結果的に、コレコレさんに相談した夢女子が叩かれる形で終わりましたが、根本的にはどちらが悪いのかは分からない、もしくはどうでも良いという決着でありました。
ある夢女子の女性が、女優として活動しながらもワンピースのキャラクター「モリア」が旦那と公言する安藤エリさんについてコレコレさんに密告したのが始まりです。
そもそも、安藤エリさんとはどのような女性なのか？
そして「夢女子」とはどのような女性のことを指した言葉なのか、「モリア」とはどのようなキャララクターなのか、簡潔に紹介してみたいと思います。
女優・安藤エリの経歴・プロフィール。モリアが旦那と公言する夢女子
名前：安藤エリ
生年月日：1999年5月10日
出身地：群馬県（韓国のハーフ）
身長：166センチ
特技：ピアノ。そろばん。水泳。テコンドー。モノマネ。韓国語。イラスト。動画編集。
趣味：アニメ鑑賞。歌。絵。声真似。
性格：浮き沈み激しい。気分屋。
旦那：ワンピースに登場するゲッコー・モリア。
好きな飲み物：いちごミルク。
苦手だった食べ物：ナス。
[ワンピースの夢女子][モリア]ってなに？意味を簡潔に 今回の騒動の中では意味不明な言葉が多く出てきます。
まずは夢女子という言葉・・・。夢女子というのはワンピースの中に登場するキャラクターのガチ恋してる女性のことを指すそうです。今回、コレコレさんに相談を持っていった女性も夢女子で、その女性に批判されていた安藤エリさんも夢女子です。
そして、「モリア」というのは、ワンピースに登場するキャラクター「ゲッコー・モリア」のことを指します。
ワンピースの中でのモリアというキャラクターは、元王下七武海だったという実力者で”影を操ることができる”カゲカゲの実（超人系）の能力者です。
名前：ゲッコー・モリア
所属：スリラーパーク
出身地：西の海
年齢：48歳〜50歳
身長：692センチ
誕生日：9月6日
懸賞金：3億2000万ベリー
好きな言葉：「お前がやれ」
[コレコレ動画]モリア担当の夢女子が男と宿泊やイジメ、著作権違反で密告？ 2月20日のコレコレさんの放送に、夢女子の方から凸。
同じく夢位女子で女優の安藤エリさんの日頃の行いをコレコレさんに拡散してもらいたいという内容でありました。
コレコレさんに凸した夢女子さんが安藤さんに怒っている理由とは、主に夢女子の文化の中でのモラル違反でありました。
簡単にまとめると、
・モリアを旦那としながらも生身の男性と宿泊していた
・同担（モリア推し）の仲間を悪く言って泣かしたりする[攻撃性]
・夢女子をいじめる。彼女のせいで界隈を去った方もいる
・業界人でアニママニアなのにキャスで著作権的にNGな配信をしている
・夢女子は基本的に鍵付き垢でひっそり活動するべきだが、彼女は堂々と活動しており夢女子のリテラシーに反する。
・モリアの嫁設定でテレビ出演し注目を浴びる。著作物の名前を借りて売名するように映る
・夢女子の存在や価値観に関して間違った認識で広めてしまっている。
・自分に意見する夢女子は速攻でブロックで話を聞かない
・揉めた相手をネットで晒した
という内容です。
これらが事実だったとすると、確かに夢女子の方が安藤さんに怒るのもわかる気がします。
コレコレは夢女子全体を否定（凸してきた女性も） コレコレさんは凸者（夢女子）さんのことも「ワンピースを勝手に所有物化してる感じが気持ち悪い」と批判。
安藤さんがモリアに対してどんな気持ちを持とうが勝手、ただしイジメなどの行為は人としてダメだと意見しました。
しかし、凸者の女性は自分のことを言われてもすぐに話を逸らしてしまい、常に「エリが〜」と会話になってない感じでありました。
リスナーたちからは、凸者に対して批判的なコメントが多く出ており、ついには放送を見ていた他の夢女子から凸者に対しても「あなたも夢女子のイメージを壊してる」と批判されてしまいました。
安藤エリの証拠を提示するが裏付けが薄い？直接の電話からは逃げる 凸者は文頭から安藤さんにかなり怒ってる様子でありました。
コレコレさんの元には、安藤さんの過去のSNSやLINEのスクショが”証拠”としてたくさん送られてきており、凸者は淡々と安藤さんのやってきたことを連語するのみでありました。
コレコレさんは二人が直接話すべきだということで、何とか安藤さんと電話を繋げようとしますが、安藤さんが事務所に所属してる身ということで、勝手にコレコレさんの放送に出るわけにはいかないということで、すぐには電話で対応はできませんでした。
同じタイミングで放送してた安藤さんのTikTokですが、安藤さんはコレコレさんの放送の件が気になって混乱したのか、途中から過呼吸になって倒れて放送が中止になってしまったそうです。
しかし、放送が進むにつれで、安藤さんが電話できる状態になり繋がりそうになった途端、凸者の女性が電話を切って逃げてしまいました。
この安藤さんとの直接の電話を逃げたということで、コレコレさんもリスナーさんも凸者に対して苛立ちの反応を示し始めました。
放送の中で安藤エリ側は良い印象で終わった 凸者の女性の電話が切れた後に、安藤さんとコレコレさんが直接会話。
コレコレさんは安藤さんが夢女子からいじめられていたのが発端だったと気づき、完全に安藤さんサイドになっていました。
しかし、コレコレさんが「たぬき掲示板」でこの件のスレが荒れていることを知って見に行くと、そこには「このままじゃエリが良い人で終わっちゃうじゃん」など書かれていました。
凸女性はたぬき掲示板のアンチ安藤エリスレの住民で代表だった？ コレコレさんの放送が終わった後に「たぬき掲示板」にて安藤エリさんのアンチスレッドが炎上していました。
スレを遡ってみると、確かに安藤エリさんのことが苦手だった夢女子は多くいたように受け取れます。
今回の件でコレコレさんに相談する際には、相談が始まる前から、円滑に話が進められるようなアドバイスなどが書かれていました。</description></item><item><title>Ariana Madix Score, Dancing, Wikipedia, Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Red Dress</title><link>/ariana-madix.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ariana-madix.html</guid><description>Ariana Madix Score, Dancing, Wikipedia, Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Red Dress -: Ariana Madix is a name that has been making waves in the world of showbiz.

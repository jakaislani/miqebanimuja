Clams filter water while they breathe. The clam pushes salt water and sand out of its shells when the fresh water is filtered. The clams will have cleansed themselves of most of the salt and sand they have accumulated after 20 minutes.</h3><h3></h3><h3>Is it okay for me to eat dead clams?</h3><h3>Clams are very perishable, and you should consume them as soon as possible once they have died. As part of the cooking procedure, they should always be killed. They may open (they are naturally filter feeders and open to feed and breathe), but should shut if touched, suggesting that they are still alive.</h3><h3></h3><h3>Is it harmful to consume a lot of clams?</h3><h3>Clams are a healthy meal to include into your diet since they are low in calories and high in protein.

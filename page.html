We love it for two reasons. First, because it’s so simple—if you have tequila, lime juice, and orange liqueur on hand, you can make it in under 5 minutes! Second, because it’s so delicious. The lime juice gives it a tart, refreshing kick, which the sweet orange liqueur (and a touch of agave) balance nicely. On a warm spring or summer evening, there’s nothing I’d rather drink. If you’re new to making cocktails, this recipe is a great place to start.

I’m sharing my classic pico de gallo recipe below, plus tips to give it the best flavor. If you’re new to making salsa, pico de gallo is a great place to start. It gives you a lot of bang for your buck, because even though it’s zesty and flavorful, it’s SO easy. You don’t need any special equipment—just a cutting board and a good knife—and the ingredient list is short and sweet. Try this fresh salsa once, and I think it’ll become a staple in your kitchen.

If you like fresh mint (like me) or bourbon (like Jack), then you absolutely should. A mint julep is made with four simple ingredients: bourbon, simple syrup, crushed ice, and fresh mint. It’s the traditional drink of the Kentucky Derby, and it might be as important a tradition as the horse race itself. The Kentucky Derby’s website claims that fans consume 125,000 mint juleps at the Churchill Downs racetrack over the race weekend each year! That said, it doesn’t have to be Derby Day for you to enjoy a mint julep. This ice…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Let’s make lemon poppy seed muffins! These classic muffins are bursting with fresh citrus flavor, and they have a moist, tender texture that’s punctuated by the poppy seeds’ crunch. I love them plain for breakfast or an afternoon snack, but they’re also wonderful with my quick lemon glaze on top. It makes them a bakery-worthy treat that would be perfect for a special occasion brunch or even dessert. Like all my muffin recipes, these lemon poppy seed muffins are easy to make. You simply stir together the batter in a couple of mixing bowls. No mixer required!

They deliver all the best qualities of oven roasted potatoes, but they cook in a fraction of the time (we’re talking under 20 minutes!). These air fryer potatoes are the perfect weeknight side dish. They’re quick and delicious—crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle, and packed with savory garlic flavor. Even picky eaters love them. These air fryer potatoes pair nicely with so many main dishes (find serving suggestions below!). Versatile, flavorful, and fast, they’ll become a new favorite in your recipe rotation.

They’re crisp and crumbly around the edges, perfect for pairing with a cup of coffee or tea. Scones can get a bad rap for being bland or dry (my husband Jack swore he didn’t like them for years), but when they’re prepared well, they shouldn’t be either of those things. I’m sharing my favorite blueberry scones recipe below.&nbsp;It’s easy to make with 10 basic ingredients, and it yields tender, flavorful, bakery-worthy scones every time. If you’re on the fence about scones, I think it’ll win you over.

It’s rich, sweet, and delightfully tart, bursting with bright citrus flavor. Imagine if the top of a lemon bar or the middle of a lemon meringue pie became a smooth and creamy spread. That’s this lemon curd. As the world’s biggest fan of anything lemon, I’ve always loved lemon curd. But I didn’t try making my own until recently. I thought it would be fussy and hard to get just right, but I was in for a surprise: Lemon curd is super easy to…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Roasted mushrooms are underrated.&nbsp;Prove me wrong: when you have mushrooms you need to use up in the fridge, is roasting the first way you think to cook them? My guess is not. Many of us are more likely to sauté mushrooms on the stove than roast them in the oven. But as delicious as sautéed mushrooms are, I’d argue that roasted mushrooms are&nbsp;even better.&nbsp;They’re crisp around the edges, meaty in the middle, and packed with savory, umami flavor.&nbsp;Plus, they roast on a single sheet pan in under 30 minutes. I’m sharing my simple roasted mushrooms recipe below. Serve it as…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Roasted asparagus is the best spring side dish! Ready in 15 minutes, it’s so easy to make. Just trim the asparagus’s woody ends, toss it with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and pop it in the oven. Roasted asparagus is also delicious. The spears are juicy and tender (NOT stringy or mushy), and their tips are browned and crisp. I could happily eat oven roasted asparagus straight off the baking sheet. But I love it even more when I season it with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, a punchy sauce, or flavorful garnishes. I’m sharing my simple roasted asparagus…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This lemon pasta recipe is my take on Italian pasta al limone. It’s buttery, garlicky, and bright with citrus, and best of all, it’s super easy to make. You can whip it up in 20 minutes using under 10 ingredients. Even though this lemon pasta feels elegant, it’s a perfect weeknight dinner. While many lemon pasta sauces call for heavy cream, I skip it here. Instead, butter, Parmesan, and starchy pasta cooking water create the pasta’s silky sauce. These simple ingredients let the fresh lemon flavor shine through. Citrus fans, get ready—you’re going to love this pasta!

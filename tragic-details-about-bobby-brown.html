Before then, I had experimented with other drugs, but marijuana was my drug of choice." At another point in the book, he shared, "At one point in my life, I used drugs uncontrollably. I was using everything I could get my hands on, from cocaine to heroin, weed and cooked cocaine."</p><p>He also claimed that Houston married him for "the wrong reasons" since she was the middle of a tabloid scandal that suggested a bisexual relationship with her assistant Robin Crawford. "In Whitney's situation, the only solution was to get married and have kids," he said. That would kill all speculation, whether it was true or not. In the short, I think I got caught up in the politics and ended up marrying one of the biggest stars in the world."</p><p>During an interview with <a href=#>ABC's Robin Roberts</a> in 2015, Brown claimed the first time he saw Houston do hard drugs was the day of their wedding â€” when she offered him some.&nbsp;"She did drugs, but drugs didn't do her. She knew how to handle herself," he said. "It only made me, you know, love and want to protect her more at the time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHBiZYJxe9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjJumm5qpYq%2Bzu9anZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

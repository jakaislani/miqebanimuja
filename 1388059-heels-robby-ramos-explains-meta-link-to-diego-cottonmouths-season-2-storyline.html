The second season of HEELS sees Ramos’ Diego Cottonmouth start a podcast and take on a larger role compared to season one. Ramos, who has his own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dropping Character podcast</a>, explained how he approached the “meta” feel of his character’s new journey.</p><p>“I think for me, man, the big thing was working with Chris. It was kind of meta in the sense that, I’ve had Chris Bauer, who plays Wild Bill, twice on the [Dropping Character] podcast. I’m always trying to pick his brain about acting. I think for Diego with Wild Bill, it’s a similar kind of connection there. Wild Bill’s already been where Diego wants to get to. And Chris Bauer’s already been where Robbie wants to get to.</p><p>“I just kind of used myself in that moment, how I would feel about Chris doing this or that. Then, playing opposite of Wild Bill is amazing, man. There’s no shortness of good lines and crazy things that Wild Bill’s saying. So, for me, it was really just kind of playing the moment with Chris.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-diego-s-evolution>Diego’s Evolution</h2><p>Diego Cottonmouth is a masked luchador on the show. Ramos also spoke about his character’s internal struggle with keeping his mask or trying to leave it behind.</p><p>“I think there was talk of [unmasking Diego]. Ultimately, we kept the mask in. I think that’s good because like you said, it should be a very hard thing to do, to shed that mask. But from Diego’s perspective, he was kind of given this mask by King Spade, right? So, there’s a little bit of that where he’s kind of taken on this identity reluctantly, in a way,” Ramos explained.</p><p>“I think for Diego, it’s going to be interesting to see that evolution of when that mask actually comes off and, and when he’s able to be a character that’s more in his wheelhouse.”</p><p>HEELS returns on July 28 on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">STARZ</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>*These interviews were recorded prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJxb2ltaWK1prHLrGSrp5KXxm6%2BwKamrGWVrb2trcinqmallamubrjIp6JmrJ9isaqxxqhknKekqbyvuc6uq6GrXaiyor%2FOp2RrZaOpvLPFy6Klng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

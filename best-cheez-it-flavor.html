I tasted every Cheez-It flavor currently on the market and found the seven best ones you should be buying right now.&nbsp;</p><p>First, a fun fact: Did you know that Cheez-Its are the color they are because they’re made with paprika? I didn’t until this taste test! Did you also know that there are approximately 400 different flavors of Cheez-Its? Okay, fine. Not really 400—it’s closer to 20, but y’all know I love to be dramatic!</p><p>When there are so many Cheez-It flavors to choose from, how do you decide? Luckily, you don’t have to! I decided for you. And while all Cheez-It flavors are good, some are really super extra good. Below is a list of the best Cheez-It flavors, ranked, that are currently on the market.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

Cheddar Jack is cheesier and much more flavorful than the OG. And don’t be fooled by Extra Cheesy Cheez-Its! Those are awful and very different from Cheddar Jack Cheez-Its. Cheddar Jack Cheez-Its are a little garlicky and have a powdered cheesy coating. They’re so salty and just all-around perfect. I’ve seen the light and I will never be going back to the original Cheez-Its again.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BEST_CHEEZ_IT_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Snap’d</p><strong>Snap’d Jalapeño Jack</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I’m snap’d for Cheez-It Snap’d Jalapeño Jack! Okay, I don’t know what that means, but I do really love them more than any of the other Cheez-It Snap’d flavors. They have a gentle spice, a nice crunch, and they’re cheesy. I brought these home and made a Frito (or, I guess Cheez-It) chili pie with them, which was incredible. They’d also be perfect for dips. They’re bigger than normal Cheez-Its and a little sturdier. If you’re in the mood to mix it up, grab a bag of these Snap’d Jalapeno Jack Cheez-Its.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BEST_CHEEZ_IT_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Most Unique</p><strong>Hot & Spicy</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>My big problem with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">snack products that are “hot” flavored</a> is that they typically just taste like chemicals. But if you’re looking for a good, spicy Cheez-It flavor, Hot & Spicy Cheez-Its taste like they are flavored with an actual vinegar-based <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hot sauce</a>. They taste like Louisiana Hot Sauce Cheez-Its. These would be so good with soup or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chili</a>. This is absolute blasphemy, but I would eat these with a bowl of gumbo. That being said, please don’t tell my dad (a former Louisiana resident and gumbo chef extraordinaire) I would eat Cheez-Its with his gumbo.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BEST_CHEEZ_IT_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Classic</p><strong>Extra Toasty</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>I didn’t love Extra Toasty Cheez-Its. I think they’re fine. I do know that they have a cult following, though. People go hard for Extra Toasty Cheez-Its and I respect that. If you’re someone who is into dry rather than wet or likes their toast almost burnt, this will be the best Cheez-It flavor for you. They also have less flavor and less salt than other Cheez-It flavors. If you want a mild accompaniment to your meal or a simple snack, grab a box of these.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BEST_CHEEZ_IT_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best White Cheddar</p><strong>White Cheddar</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Rite Aid</a><p>White cheddar lovers, rejoice! White Cheddar Cheez-Its are very, very good. They have a little bit of a twang and a good amount of salt. They have a distinct white cheddar flavor that sets them apart from regular Cheez-Its. They’re not better than regular Cheez-Its, in my opinion. But in all honesty, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m not a white cheddar lover</a> in general. Despite not being a white cheddar lover, I still loved these.

I think they’re fun, but I don’t think they’re an improvement on the Cheez-It necessarily. If you do like something related to but different from a Cheez-It, the Sharp White Cheddar Grooves are the move. They’ve got a nice crunch and a light flavor. They’re milder than the White Cheddar Cheez-Its and have a more gentle twang. These are great for any lovers of subtlety out there.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BEST_CHEEZ_IT_INSET_07.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Puff’d</p><strong>Scorchin’ Hot Cheddar Puff’d</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>I was surprised by how much I liked the Scorchin’ Hot Cheddar Puff’d Cheez-Its. They’re kind of like a spicy puffy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheeto</a> that’s a little denser. Once again, like the Hot & Spicy Cheez-Its, these have a great authentic spice that tastes like it was made in a kitchen rather than a lab. I love that! While I don’t know if I’d find myself reaching for Puff’d Cheez-Its instead of puffy Cheetos, I would absolutely help myself to a handful of Puff’d Scorchin’ Hot Cheddar Cheez-Its at a party.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc /</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rhett-link-s-pick>Rhett & Link’s Pick</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cheddar-jack-cheez-its><a href=# rel=noopener>Cheddar Jack Cheez-Its</a></h3><p>We were all on the same page when it came to the best Cheez-It flavor. Cheddar Jack was the flavor of choice for both Sporked and Rhett & Link when they did a Cheez-It Gut Check on Good Mythical Morning. It tastes like a classic Cheez-It with even more delicious, cheesy flavor.

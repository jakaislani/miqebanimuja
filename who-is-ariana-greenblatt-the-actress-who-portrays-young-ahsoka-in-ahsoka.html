She played Daphne Diaz on the show, the younger sister of lead character Harley Diaz, played by Jenna Ortega. Greenblatt’s first film role was in the comedy A Bad Moms Christmas (2017), and she later appeared in supporting roles in Love and Monsters and The One and Only Ivan, both released in 2020. Greenblatt also provided the voice of young Velma Dinkley in the animated movie Scoob!</p><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>Similarly to Ahsoka, Greenblatt portrayed a young Gamora during flashback sequences in Avengers: Infinity War, appearing as the child version of Zoe Saldaña’s character. Just like in her new role, Greenblatt wore extensive prosthetic makeup as the child iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy favorite. Her most recognizable role, however, has come from 2023’s biggest breakout hit. The young actress played Sasha, daughter of Gloria (America Ferrera) in Greta Gerwig’s dolled-up critical darling and box office sensation Barbie. How many 16-year-olds can say they’ve had major roles in two multi-billion dollar movies?</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=false>Next year, Greenblatt is set to play Tiny Tina in Borderlands, a film adaptation of the popular video game franchise of the same name, directed by acclaimed filmmaker Eli Roth. It’s too early to tell how how that one will fare financially, but history has shown us that Greenblatt could prove to be a good luck charm for what Lionsgate is no doubt hoping will become a franchise to rival Marvel, Star Wars, and the Barbie-verse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmaho2Kus7XAp5hmn6Kasq%2Buy5qrrWWknbJurcKtqZ6ro2LEqbuMqaarrKKWxrR52Kisp59dlrW0u8qaZKKmXZa1tLvKmmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

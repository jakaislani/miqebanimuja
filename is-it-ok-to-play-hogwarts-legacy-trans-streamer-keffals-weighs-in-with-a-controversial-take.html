In the same tweet, they also condemn the clashes that have arisen on social media following the game’s release as “culture war bulls**t.”</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>letting everyone know that you aren't transphobic if you want to play the wizard game. this is all just culture war bullshit and not relevant to whether or not you support us and our community</p>— keffals (@keffals) <a href=#>February 9, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>“Keffals” is the online alias of transgender activist and Twitch streamer Clara Sorrenti, who rose to notoriety following her efforts to take down the alt-right hate site known as KiwiFarms.

Only one week ago Keffals encouraged her online followers to harass and infiltrate the accounts of the so-called “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tenderqueer</a>” Twitter community in order to spread misinformation and mistrust of Picrew, a paper doll-style&nbsp;avatar&nbsp;maker website.</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>They also explicitly requested that those doing so pretend to be Black in order to appear more diverse. This was during Black History Month, which she claimed not to know was happening <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">due to living in Canada</a> (though February is Black History Month in Canada as well as the U.S.). She has also been called out for repeatedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">using an ableist slur </a>while debating with a disabled user while streaming and later admitting she was purposely <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">using the word as an attack</a>.</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>While nothing Keffals has posted or said has indicated that she is joining the ranks of TERFdom or even becoming a J.K. Rowling apologist, her recent behavior and the rather flippant use of the term “culture war bulls**t” may indicate at the least a shift in viewpoint since her “ratio” tweet. In any case, while it may not be transphobic to play a Harry Potter video game or other branded merchandise, it undoubtedly puts money in the pocket of Rowling who has been nothing short of unequivocal in her transphobia.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>Disclosure: We Got This Covered Assigning Editor Allie Capps recently appeared on a stream with Keffals discussing and criticizing her controversial behavior.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKxlmal6sLeMraZmqJyWxm60zqCumqqkqHqtscaamrJlpKeur7%2BMrKurnZGisrN5yp6dn5mcqHq4scign6xlmaN6uLXToWSaZZOku7W%2Bzq%2Bcq6uZlrluwMCknGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

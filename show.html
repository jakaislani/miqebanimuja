The Pentium D 820, running at 2.8GHz, was the first Intel processor we recommended since Intel's Northwood core. &nbsp;It was no surprise to anyone that Prescott was too hot and offered no real performance advantage to justify its downside when compared to AMD's Athlon 64 CPUs.&nbsp; With the Pentium D, Intel still had the heat problems and underwhelming performance, but for heavy multitaskers and users of multithreaded applications the performance could not be beat.&nbsp; The Pentium D 820 debuted at $241, putting it at about the same price as a single core Athlon 64 3500+.&nbsp;</p><p>AMD eventually responded by introducing an Athlon 64 X2 3800+, priced at $354.&nbsp; While it was still more expensive than Intel's entry level dual core, it was a step in the right direction for AMD and the X2 3800+ quickly became a favorite among enthusiasts.&nbsp; The X2 3800+ managed to outperform, in many cases, Intel's most expensive dual core processors while running a lot cooler and being offered at a much better price point.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel's ability to undercut AMD's pricing on dual core processors is not too difficult to understand.&nbsp; Until recently, AMD has only had a single plant producing 90nm processors on 200mm wafers, meaning that every dual core CPU they produce made a serious dent in the number of total CPUs they can produce.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though AMD's new Fab 36 just started shipping revenue generating product, dual core chips will continue to come out of Fab 30 for the time being.&nbsp; Intel, by comparison, has a total of five 300mm fabs currently in production that crank out both 90nm and 65nm CPUs.&nbsp; Being able to produce chips on 300mm wafers itself means that you can make more chips at a time, but also having many more fabs helps as well.&nbsp; Intel estimates that its five 300mm fabs can produce as many chips as approximately eight of its older 200mm fabs.&nbsp; What this all boils down to is that pricing its entry-level dual core processor in the $200 - $250 range is not too difficult for Intel, but with the introduction of the Pentium D 900 series the deal was about to get even sweeter.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Pentium D 900 series, Intel took its dual core processors and started making them on a 65nm process.&nbsp; Along with the die shrink Intel equipped their 65nm offerings with twice the L2 cache as their 90nm 800 series, thus making them even more desirable.&nbsp; The icing on the cake was that the Pentium D 900 series was not much more expensive than the 800 series it was replacing; the Pentium D 920 can be found today for as low as $244.&nbsp;</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/cpu/cheapdualcore/pentium_d.jpg width=384 height=205 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>With Intel intent on moving all of its processors over to 65nm, the older 90nm Pentium D line got a nice price cut.&nbsp; The once $240+ Pentium D 820 is now a <a href=#>$160 chip</a>, making it around the price of a single core Athlon 64 3200+.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the single core AMD CPU will still do better in gaming, the Pentium D 820 will definitely hold its own in any multithreaded environments or encoding tasks.&nbsp; To even further move the market to dual core, Intel quietly introduced yet another processor - the 90nm Pentium D 805.&nbsp; Clocked at 2.66GHz with a meager 533MHz FSB (compared to 800MHz of the other Pentium D CPUs), the Pentium D 805 can be had for as little as $132.&nbsp;</p><p>Sit back and think about that for a moment; for $133 you are getting a dual core processor that can run in any LGA-775 Intel 945 based motherboard.&nbsp; It wasn't very long ago that a SMP system would cost you significantly more than a high end desktop setup, but thanks to the move to dual core CPUs and some very aggressive pricing on Intel's part, you can now have a dual core processor for about $20 more than a Celeron.&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly we've been a bit too high end focused lately here on AnandTech, as seemingly all that's been released these days is Extreme Edition this and FX that.&nbsp; But if you have to upgrade today, now is truly a great time to buy something low end as you await the next-generation of CPUs and platforms from AMD and Intel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH56hJU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;

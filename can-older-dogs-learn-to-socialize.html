This could give rise to serious behavioral problems, such as aggression or nervous behavior.<h2>Why is my dog not friendly with other dogs?</h2>Aggression between unfamiliar dogs can be due to fear, poor communication, defensive, possessive behavior over resources (including perhaps family members or other pets) or territorial behavior over territory or owner. Aggression between dogs can result in injury to dogs and/or to the people trying to separate them.<h2>Can an older dog still be trained?</h2>In fact, adult dogs can sometimes be easier to train than puppies because they have a longer attention span and more self control. Puppies can sometimes pick things up faster than older dogs, and older dogs can be a little more set in their ways, but you can absolutely train a dog of any age.<h2>Why is my dog aggressive towards others?</h2>There are multiple reasons that a dog may exhibit aggression toward family members.

It usually take several months for two newly acquainted dogs to be comfortable with each other. Supervision is absolutely necessary because a fight might occur if these dogs are left alone.<h2>What breeds of dogs don't get along?</h2><p>Least Dog-Friendly Dogs:</p><ul><li>Chihuahua. English Bulldog.</li><li>German Shepherd Dog. Great Dane.</li><li>Pomeranian. Schnauzer.</li><li>Shar-Pei.</li></ul><h2>What do you do when your dog is aggressive towards other dogs?</h2>Remain Calm and Assertive- No matter how angry you are at your dog for their aggressive behaviour, shouting at them will only worsen their aggression. Hold your dog back firmly (don't tug suddenly as this may also distress them) and calmly walk on.<h2>Is it good to send your dog away for training?</h2>Good training requires a strong bond with your dog.<p>Sending your dog away will not help you with bond building, and training is a great opportunity to establish better trust. Board-and-train means missing out on some of that bonding.</p><h2>Do dogs get more obedient as they get older?</h2>"Dogs get less active with age, and that should give hope to the people who have puppies that are too active," Houpt said. "And while they become less oriented to problem-solving and novelty-seeking as they get older, they remain obedient and social, which is probably the most important thing for owners."<h2>Can you train an older dog not to be aggressive?</h2>Through talking to your vet, making a note of their triggers, giving them space, and offering them consistency, you can work to reduce aggression in your senior dog. Even the most docile dog can have issues with aggression as they age.<h2>Is it too late to train my dog to be a service dog?</h2>The years after the 10th birthday are considered a retirement phase, where a service dog is no longer working as a service dog and can spend the rest of his/her life as a pet. There are some schools for service dog training, that require handlers to retire their service dogs around the ages of 10 and 11.<h2>How long does it take to train an emotional support dog?</h2>Training a service dog can take a long time. Most working dogs require 1 – 2 years to be fully trained as a service dog with public access skills. You can train your emotional support pup in basic commands in just a few weeks. However, remember that your dog's training is never complete.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWannJmys3nDqJ6sZZyarrO6jK2mZqufmLaiuMiznA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 RaveDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

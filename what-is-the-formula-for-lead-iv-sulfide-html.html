It is very soft, highly malleable, and ductile, and it is a poor conductor of electricity when compared to other metals. It is very corrosion resistant, however when exposed to air, it tarnishes quickly. Lead isotopes are the end products of each of the three series of naturally occurring radioactive elements.

Lead(II) chloride is a white substance that melts at 501 degrees Celsius. The compound is only very little soluble in cold water, but it is much more soluble in hot water.</p><p></p><h3>Why is PbCl2 an ionic compound whereas PbCl4 is a covalent one?</h3><p>Why is it that PbCl2 is ionic yet PbCl4 is covalent? According to Fajan’s rule, the more the charge on the cation, the greater the capacity of the cation to polarise the bonding electrons towards itself, resulting in a stronger covalent character in the complex. PbCl has a higher charge than water and is hence covalent. Because the charge on Pb is lower in PbCl,</p><p></p><h3>Is pbcl2 watery in nature?</h3><p>It is an inorganic compound that is a white solid at room temperature. Lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) is an inorganic compound that is a white solid at room temperature. It is only marginally soluble in water.
